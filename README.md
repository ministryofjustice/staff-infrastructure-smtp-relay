# Staff Infrastructure SMTP Relay Server  

## Introduction  

This repository builds the docker image for the SMTP Relay server and pushes it to the Shared Services Elastic Container Repository, so that the pre-configured ECS task can pull down this image and launch a new container.  

This repository depends on the network services infrastructure repository, which builds the underlying base infrastructure with required ECR repository and ECS service definitions to work with this docker image.  

## Related Repositories  

This repository builds the docker image for SMTP Relay server only. Here are some of the other related repositories:  

- [staff-device-shared-services-infrastructure](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-device-shared-services-infrastructure)  
- [staff-infrastructure-network-services](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-infrastructure-network-services)

## Technical Guide  

Once you have deployed the infrastructure, you may use this guide to build and push the SMTP Relay server image.  

### Prerequisites

To be able to follow this guide, you need to have the following already:  
 
- [System infrastructure deployed](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-infrastructure-network-services/blob/main/documentation/how-to-deploy-the-infrastructure.md)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [AWS Vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault#installing) set up.  
- Access to [Moj AWS SSO](https://moj.awsapps.com/start#/).  
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) installed.

| :tada: TIP |  
|:-----|  
| You may configure your AWS Vault to use AWS SSO. A [step-by-step guide](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/cloud-operations/documentation/team-guide/best-practices/use-aws-sso.html#re-configure-aws-vault) can be found in our team documentation site. |  

### Prepare the variables  

1. Clone this repo to a local directory.  
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.  
1. Modify the `.env` file and replace all placeholders with correct values.  

### Authenticate Docker with AWS ECR

The Docker base image is stored in ECR. Prior to building the container you must authenticate Docker to the ECR registry. [Details can be found here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/Registries.html#registry_auth).

If you have [aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault#installing) configured with credentials for shared services, do the following to authenticate:

```bash
make authenticate-docker
```  

### Build the image  

4. To build the image on your local docker, run:  

```shell
make build-dev
```  

### Run the server locally  

4. To run the SMTP Relay server on your local docker, run:  

```shell
make run
```

### Test locally  

5. To test the build locally, run:  

```shell
make test
```  

### Push your docker image  

6. To push the built image on to your isolated ECR repository, run:  

```shell  
make publish  
```  

### Deploy a force remote ECS restart  

```shell
make deploy  
```  

### Stopping Local Environment

Once you have finished using the docker image, to shut down the environment, run:  

```shell  
make stop  
```
